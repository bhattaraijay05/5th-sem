5) Demonstrate Object Serialization in python by creating a custom
class called Employee. Employee will store Employee name, age,
salary, married and having kid. Save it and load it up into a separate
object and display the new object.

6) Demonstrate Serialization in python by creating a custom class
called Player. Player will store an id, name. Save it and load it up into
a separate object and display the new object.
7) write a program to count the number of upper-case and lower-case
alphabets present in a text file “data.txt”.Suppose we have created a file with 500 lines of data and the
file object reference is “f”. Illustrate fseek() function for the
following.

1. Beginning of the file
2. Move to 100 th location from the beginning of the file
3. Move to 10 th location from end of the file
4. Move file pointer to the end of the file
Returns current position in the file
2) Consider a file with 100 lines of data and the file object reference
is “f”. Illustrate what each of these following operations does:
1. f.seek(0,)
2. f.seek(50,1)
3. f.seek(-5,2)
